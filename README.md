AG-UI is a lightweight, event-based protocol that standardizes how AI agents connect to front-end applications. Built for simplicity and flexibility, it enables seamless integration between your AI agents and user interfaces.

# What is AG-UI? (Specification)

AG-UI is an open, lightweight, event-based protocol for agent-human interaction, designed for simplicity & flexibility:

- During agent executions, agent backends **emit events _compatible_ with one of AG-UI's ~16 standard event types**
- Agent backends can **accept one of a few simple AG-UI compatible inputs** as arguments

**AG-UI includes a flexible middleware layer** that ensures compatibility across diverse environments:

- Works with **any event transport** (SSE, WebSockets, webhooks, etc.)
- Allows for **loose event format matching**, enabling broad agent and app interoperability

It also ships with a **reference HTTP implementation** and **default connector** to help teams get started fast.

## Why AG-UI?

AG-UI was developed based on real-world requirements and practical experience building in-app agent interactions.

## Where does AGUI fit in the agentic protocol stack?
AG-UI is complementary to the other 2 top agentic protocols
- MCP gives agents tools
- A2A allows agents to communicate with other agents
- AG-UI brings agents into user-facing applications
